# Create VS Code Projects

This BASH script will create a new VSCode C++ project from scratch.

## Usage

Place this script in the directory in which you will store your CSC 1810 projects. When you move on to CSC 1820, make a directory for that class and copy this script over to the new one.

All you need to do, then is double click on the script and enter the name of the new project.
